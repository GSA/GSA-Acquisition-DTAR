Under the authority of 26 U.S.C. 6103(h)(1), officers and employees of the Department of the Treasury, including the IRS, may have access to taxpayer return information as necessary for purposes of tax administration. The Department of the Treasury has determined that an IRS contractor's compliance with the tax laws is a tax administration matter and that the access to and use of taxpayer return information is needed for determining an offeror's eligibility to receive an award, including but not limited to implementation of the statutory prohibition of making an award to corporations that have an unpaid Federal tax liability (see FAR 9.104-5).

If the offeror recently settled a delinquent Federal tax liability, the offeror may want to take steps to obtain information in order to demonstrate the offeror's responsibility to the contracting officer (see FAR 9.104-5).
