      <div class="body conbody">
         <p class="p P">This section provides policy and procedure for using incremental funding for fixed-price, time-and-material and labor-hour contracts during a period in which funds are provided to Treasury Departmental Offices or Bureaus, under a continuing resolution (CR). HCAs may develop necessary supplemental internal procedures as well as guidance to advise potential offerors, offerors and contractors of these policies and procedures. Additionally, Bureaus who receive non-appropriated funds may utilize and tailor these policies and procedures to fit their needs.

      <div class="body conbody">
         <p class="p P">“Continuing Resolution” means an appropriation, in the form of a joint resolution, that provides budget authority for federal agencies, specific activities, or both to continue operation until the regular appropriations are enacted. Typically, a continuing resolution is used when legislative action on appropriations is not completed by the beginning of a fiscal year.

         <span class="ph autonumber">1032.770-3</span> General.</h2>
      <div class="body conbody">
         <p class="p P">The Anti-Deficiency Act, 31 U.S.C. 1341 and FAR 32.702, states that no officer or employee of the Government may create or authorize an obligation in excess of the funds available, or in advance of appropriations unless otherwise authorized by law. A CR provides funding for continuing projects or activities that were conducted in the prior fiscal year for which appropriations, funds, or other authority was previously made available. Each CR is governed by the specific terms in that specific CR (<em class="ph i">e.g.</em> duration of the CR) and under certain CRs, the funding amounts available for award of contract actions are inadequate to fund the entire amounts needed for some contract actions.
